# Brute Force Uninstaller #

Brute Force Uninstaller (BFU) is a scripting program that can execute a series of preset commands like a Windows batch file, aimed at uninstalled programs that are hard to remove, uninstall improperly or simply unwanted. Scripts are plaintext and can be written with Notepad, and the command syntax is very transparent. Documentation on the commands is available in the included BFU.rtf.

BFU is very complete and powerful, has a small memory footprint and has no installer or uninstaller.

*Compatible with: All Windows versions*
